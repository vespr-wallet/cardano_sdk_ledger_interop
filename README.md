**Cardano SDK Ledger Interop** is a Dart package that bridges the gap between [cardano_dart_types](https://github.com/vespr-wallet/cardano_dart_types), [cardano_flutter_sdk](https://github.com/vespr-wallet/cardano_flutter_sdk), and [ledger_cardano_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/ledger_cardano_plus). It provides the essential mapping and conversion logic to serialize Cardano transactions and related data structures for use with Ledger hardware wallets.

---

## Overview

When building Cardano applications in Dart/Flutter, you often need to sign transactions with a Ledger device. However, the data models and serialization formats used by the Cardano SDKs differ from those required by Ledger's signing APIs. This package provides the "connective tissue"â€”it takes transactions and types from the Cardano SDKs and converts them into the specific formats and models required by the Ledger device libraries.

- **Input:** Cardano transaction models from `cardano_flutter_sdk` / `cardano_dart_types`
- **Output:** Data structures and serialization compatible with `ledger_cardano_plus` for secure signing on Ledger devices

---

## Features

- **Transaction Mapping:** Convert Cardano transactions into Ledger-compatible signing requests.
- **Type Conversion:** Map Cardano SDK types (inputs, outputs, certificates, etc.) to Ledger models.
- **Serialization:** Prepare and serialize data for Ledger device communication.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error types for unsupported or invalid transaction scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cardano_sdk_ledger_interop: ^0.5.5
  cardano_flutter_sdk: ^2.5.0
  ledger_cardano_plus: ^0.5.5
  cardano_dart_types: # version as required by cardano_flutter_sdk
```

Then run:

```sh
dart pub get
```

### Usage Example

Here's a minimal example of converting a Cardano transaction to a Ledger signing request:

```dart
import 'package:cardano_dart_types/cardano_dart_types.dart';
import 'package:cardano_sdk_ledger_interop/src/mapper.dart';

void main() async {
  final rawTxHex = '...'; // Your transaction CBOR hex
  final tx = CardanoTransaction.deserializeFromHex(rawTxHex);

  final ledgerRequest = await tx.toLedgerSigningRequest(
    accountIndex: 0,
    inputUtxoToAddress: {
      // Map of UTXO#idx to address
      'txhash#index': 'addr1...',
    },
    maxDeriveAddressCount: 10,
    networkId: NetworkId.mainnet,
    xPubBech32: 'xpub1...',
  );

  print(ledgerRequest);
}
```

For a more complete example, see [`example/hex_tx_to_ledger_example.dart`](example/hex_tx_to_ledger_example.dart).

---

## API

The main entry point is the extension on `CardanoTransaction`:

```dart
Future<SignatureRequestData> toLedgerSigningRequest({
  required NetworkId networkId,
  required String xPubBech32,
  required int accountIndex,
  required int maxDeriveAddressCount,
  required Map<UtxoAndIndex, Bech32OrBase58CardanoAddress> inputUtxoToAddress,
})
```

This produces a `SignatureRequestData` object, which contains all the information needed to sign the transaction on a Ledger device.

### Error Handling

Custom errors are defined in `lib/src/errors/errors.dart`:

- `CardanoLedgerInteropError`
- `NotSupportedError`
- `InvalidTransactionError`
